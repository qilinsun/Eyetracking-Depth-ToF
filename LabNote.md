# OnlineDigitalHuman-3D-Reconstruction

## Final Goal

Realize a quasi real-time 3D avantar reconstruction system

idea

## Todo list

- [ ] 3Dxxxxx

======================================================

## Week (2), April 11th, 2023

#### Todo List Week (2)

- [ ] Get PointClouds using the Okulo Camera

- [ ] Debug the voting process to get accurate pose estimation

### What achieved week (2)

#### 1 Pipeline

Add the filtering process described by the essay. Now the whole pipeline is complete.

#### 2 Results

Carried out tests on Biwi database and images of my self. Now faces (with relatively eular angles) can be recognized very accurately and efficiently (within around 10 seconds).

#### 3 other

### Problems left week (2)

The pointclouds from the Okulo camera are not clean enough. Considering to apply a 2-D face recognition process to filter out objects other than human faces. A brute force alternative solution is to manually take a clean image.
